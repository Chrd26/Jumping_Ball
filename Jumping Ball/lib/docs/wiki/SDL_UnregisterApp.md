# SDL_UnregisterApp

Deregister the win32 window class from an [SDL_RegisterApp](SDL_RegisterApp) call.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_main.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_main.h)

## Syntax

```c
void SDL_UnregisterApp(void);

```

## Remarks

This can be called to undo the effects of
[SDL_RegisterApp](SDL_RegisterApp).

Most applications do not need to, and should not, call this directly; SDL
will call it when deinitializing the video subsystem.

It is safe to call this multiple times, as long as every call is eventually
paired with a prior call to [SDL_RegisterApp](SDL_RegisterApp). The window
class will only be deregistered when the registration counter in
[SDL_RegisterApp](SDL_RegisterApp) decrements to zero through calls to this
function.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
