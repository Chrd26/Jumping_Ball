# SDL_IOFromDynamicMem

Use this function to create an [SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream) that is backed by dynamically allocated memory.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_iostream.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_iostream.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_IOStream* SDL_IOFromDynamicMem(void);

```

## Return Value

Returns a pointer to a new [SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream) structure, or NULL
if it fails; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This supports the following properties to provide access to the memory and
control over allocations: -
[`SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_POINTER`](SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_POINTER):
a pointer to the internal memory of the stream. This can be set to NULL to
transfer ownership of the memory to the application, which should free the
memory with [SDL_free](SDL_free)(). If this is done, the next operation on
the stream must be [SDL_CloseIO](SDL_CloseIO)(). -
[`SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_DYNAMIC_CHUNKSIZE_NUMBER`](SDL_PROP_IOSTREAM_DYNAMIC_CHUNKSIZE_NUMBER):
memory will be allocated in multiples of this size, defaulting to 1024.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
