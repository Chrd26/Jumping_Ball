int SDL_CopyProperties(SDL_PropertiesID src, SDL_PropertiesID dst);

```

## Function Parameters

|             |                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| **src**     | the properties to copy     |
| **dst**     | the destination properties |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call

exception of properties requiring cleanup (set using
[SDL_SetPropertyWithCleanup](SDL_SetPropertyWithCleanup)()), which will not
be copied. Any property that already exists on `dst` will be overwritten.
