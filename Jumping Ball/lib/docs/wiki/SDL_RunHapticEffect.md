# SDL_RunHapticEffect

Run the haptic effect on its associated haptic device.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_haptic.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_haptic.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_RunHapticEffect(SDL_Haptic *haptic, int effect, Uint32 iterations);

```

## Function Parameters

|                    |                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **haptic**         | the [SDL_Haptic](SDL_Haptic) device to run the effect on                                                       |
| **effect**         | the ID of the haptic effect to run                                                                             |
| **iterations**     | the number of iterations to run the effect; use [`SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY`](SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY) to repeat forever |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

To repeat the effect over and over indefinitely, set `iterations` to
[`SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY`](SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY). (Repeats the envelope -
attack and fade.) To make one instance of the effect last indefinitely (so
the effect does not fade), set the effect's `length` in its structure/union
to [`SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY`](SDL_HAPTIC_INFINITY) instead.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
