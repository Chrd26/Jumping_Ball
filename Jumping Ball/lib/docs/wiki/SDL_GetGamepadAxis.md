# SDL_GetGamepadAxis

Get the current state of an axis control on a gamepad.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h)

## Syntax

```c
Sint16 SDL_GetGamepadAxis(SDL_Gamepad *gamepad, SDL_GamepadAxis axis);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **gamepad**     | a gamepad                                                            |
| **axis**        | an axis index (one of the [SDL_GamepadAxis](SDL_GamepadAxis) values) |

## Return Value

Returns axis state (including 0) on success or 0 (also) on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

The axis indices start at index 0.

For thumbsticks, the state is a value ranging from -32768 (up/left) to
32767 (down/right).

Triggers range from 0 when released to 32767 when fully pressed, and never
return a negative value. Note that this differs from the value reported by
the lower-level [SDL_GetJoystickAxis](SDL_GetJoystickAxis)(), which
normally uses the full range.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
