    SDL_LOGICAL_PRESENTATION_LETTERBOX, /**< The rendered content is fit to the largest dimension and the other dimension is letterboxed with black bars */
    SDL_LOGICAL_PRESENTATION_OVERSCAN,  /**< The rendered content is fit to the smallest dimension and the other dimension extends beyond the output bounds */
