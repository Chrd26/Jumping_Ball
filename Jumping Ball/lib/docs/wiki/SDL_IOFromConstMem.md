# SDL_IOFromConstMem

Use this function to prepare a read-only memory buffer for use with [SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream).

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_iostream.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_iostream.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_IOStream* SDL_IOFromConstMem(const void *mem, size_t size);

```

## Function Parameters

|              |                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **mem**      | a pointer to a read-only buffer to feed an [SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream) stream |
| **size**     | the buffer size, in bytes                                                      |

## Return Value

Returns a pointer to a new [SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream) structure, or NULL
if it fails; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This function sets up an [SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream) struct based on a
memory area of a certain size. It assumes the memory area is not writable.

Attempting to write to this [SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream) stream will report
an error without writing to the memory buffer.

This memory buffer is not copied by the [SDL_IOStream](SDL_IOStream); the
pointer you provide must remain valid until you close the stream. Closing
the stream will not free the original buffer.

If you need to write to a memory buffer, you should use
[SDL_IOFromMem](SDL_IOFromMem)() with a writable buffer of memory instead.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
