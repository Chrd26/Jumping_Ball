###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_assert

An assertion test that is normally performed only in debug builds.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_assert.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_assert.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_assert(condition) if (assertion_enabled && (condition)) { trigger_assertion; }
```

## Macro Parameters

|                   |                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| **condition**     | boolean value to test |

## Remarks

This macro is enabled when the [SDL_ASSERT_LEVEL](SDL_ASSERT_LEVEL) is >=
2, otherwise it is disabled. This is meant to only do these tests in debug
builds, so they can tend to be more expensive, and they are meant to bring
everything to a halt when they fail, with the programmer there to assess
the problem.

In short: you can sprinkle these around liberally and assume they will
evaporate out of the build when building for end-users.

When assertions are disabled, this wraps `condition` in a `sizeof`
operator, which means any function calls and side effects will not run, but
the compiler will not complain about any otherwise-unused variables that
are only referenced in the assertion.

One can set the environment variable "[SDL_ASSERT](SDL_ASSERT)" to one of
several strings ("abort", "break", "retry", "ignore", "always_ignore") to
force a default behavior, which may be desirable for automation purposes.
If your platform requires GUI interfaces to happen on the main thread but
you're debugging an assertion in a background thread, it might be desirable
to set this to "break" so that your debugger takes control as soon as
assert is triggered, instead of risking a bad UI interaction (deadlock,
etc) in the application.

Note that [SDL_ASSERT](SDL_ASSERT) is an _environment variable_ and not an
SDL hint! Please refer to your platform's documentation for how to set it!

## Version

This macro is available since SDL 3.0.0.
