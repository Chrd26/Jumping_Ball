# SDL_strupr

Convert a string to uppercase.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h)

## Syntax

```c
char* SDL_strupr(char *str);

```

## Remarks

**WARNING**: Regardless of system locale, this will only convert ASCII
values 'A' through 'Z' to uppercase.

This function operates on a null-terminated string of bytes--even if it is
malformed UTF-8!--and converts ASCII characters 'a' through 'z' to their
uppercase equivalents in-place, returning the original `str` pointer.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
