# SDL_GetCameraDeviceSupportedFormats

Get the list of native formats/sizes a camera supports.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_camera.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_camera.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_CameraSpec* SDL_GetCameraDeviceSupportedFormats(SDL_CameraDeviceID devid, int *count);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **devid**     | the camera device instance ID to query.                                   |
| **count**     | a pointer filled in with the number of elements in the list. Can be NULL. |

## Return Value

Returns a 0 terminated array of [SDL_CameraSpecs](SDL_CameraSpecs), which
should be freed with [SDL_free](SDL_free)(), or NULL on error; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more details.

## Remarks

This returns a list of all formats and frame sizes that a specific camera
can offer. This is useful if your app can accept a variety of image formats
and sizes and so want to find the optimal spec that doesn't require
conversion.

This function isn't strictly required; if you call
[SDL_OpenCameraDevice](SDL_OpenCameraDevice) with a NULL spec, SDL will
choose a native format for you, and if you instead specify a desired
format, it will transparently convert to the requested format on your
behalf.

If `count` is not NULL, it will be filled with the number of elements in
the returned array. Additionally, the last element of the array has all
fields set to zero (this element is not included in `count`).

The returned list is owned by the caller, and should be released with
[SDL_free](SDL_free)() when no longer needed.

Note that it's legal for a camera to supply a list with only the zeroed
final element and `*count` set to zero; this is what will happen on
Emscripten builds, since that platform won't tell _anything_ about
available cameras until you've opened one, and won't even tell if there
_is_ a camera until the user has given you permission to check through a
scary warning popup.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
