###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_HINT_STORAGE_USER_DRIVER

A variable that specifies a backend to use for user storage.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_STORAGE_USER_DRIVER "SDL_STORAGE_USER_DRIVER"
```

## Remarks

By default, SDL will try all available storage backends in a reasonable
order until it finds one that can work, but this hint allows the app or
user to force a specific target, such as "pc" if, say, you are on Steam but
want to avoid SteamRemoteStorage for user data.

This hint should be set before SDL is initialized.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
