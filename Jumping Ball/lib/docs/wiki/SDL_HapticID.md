# SDL_HapticID

This is a unique ID for a haptic device for the time it is connected to the system, and is never reused for the lifetime of the application.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_haptic.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_haptic.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef Uint32 SDL_HapticID;
```

## Remarks

If the haptic device is disconnected and reconnected, it will get a new ID.

The ID value starts at 1 and increments from there. The value 0 is an
invalid ID.

## Version

This datatype is available since SDL 3.0.0.
