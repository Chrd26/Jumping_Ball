###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_Folder

The type of the OS-provided default folder for a specific purpose.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_filesystem.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_filesystem.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef enum SDL_Folder
{
    /** The folder which contains all of the current user's data, preferences,
      and documents. It usually contains most of the other folders. If a
      requested folder does not exist, the home folder can be considered a safe
      fallback to store a user's documents. */
    SDL_FOLDER_HOME,
    /** The folder of files that are displayed on the desktop. Note that the
      existence of a desktop folder does not guarantee that the system does
      show icons on its desktop; certain GNU/Linux distros with a graphical
      environment may not have desktop icons. */
    SDL_FOLDER_DESKTOP,
    /** User document files, possibly application-specific. This is a good
      place to save a user's projects. */
    SDL_FOLDER_DOCUMENTS,
    /** Standard folder for user files downloaded from the internet. */
    SDL_FOLDER_DOWNLOADS,
    /** Music files that can be played using a standard music player (mp3,
      ogg...). */
    SDL_FOLDER_MUSIC,
    /** Image files that can be displayed using a standard viewer (png,
      jpg...). */
    SDL_FOLDER_PICTURES,
    /** Files that are meant to be shared with other users on the same
      computer. */
    SDL_FOLDER_PUBLICSHARE,
    /** Save files for games. */
    SDL_FOLDER_SAVEDGAMES,
    /** Application screenshots. */
    SDL_FOLDER_SCREENSHOTS,
    /** Template files to be used when the user requests the desktop environment
      to create a new file in a certain folder, such as "New Text File.txt".
      Any file in the Templates folder can be used as a starting point for a
      new file. */
    SDL_FOLDER_TEMPLATES,
    /** Video files that can be played using a standard video player (mp4,
      webm...). */
    SDL_FOLDER_VIDEOS
} SDL_Folder;
```

## Remarks

Note that the Trash folder isn't included here, because trashing files
usually involves extra OS-specific functionality to remember the file's
original location.
