# SDL_GetWindowBordersSize

Get the size of a window's borders (decorations) around the client area.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_video.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_video.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_GetWindowBordersSize(SDL_Window *window, int *top, int *left, int *bottom, int *right);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **window**     | the window to query the size values of the border (decorations) from             |
| **top**        | pointer to variable for storing the size of the top border; NULL is permitted    |
| **left**       | pointer to variable for storing the size of the left border; NULL is permitted   |
| **bottom**     | pointer to variable for storing the size of the bottom border; NULL is permitted |
| **right**      | pointer to variable for storing the size of the right border; NULL is permitted  |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

Note: If this function fails (returns -1), the size values will be
initialized to 0, 0, 0, 0 (if a non-NULL pointer is provided), as if the
window in question was borderless.

Note: This function may fail on systems where the window has not yet been
decorated by the display server (for example, immediately after calling
[SDL_CreateWindow](SDL_CreateWindow)). It is recommended that you wait at
least until the window has been presented and composited, so that the
window system has a chance to decorate the window and provide the border
dimensions to SDL.

This function also returns -1 if getting the information is not supported.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
