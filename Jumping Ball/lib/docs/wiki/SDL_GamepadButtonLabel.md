###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_GamepadButtonLabel

The set of gamepad button labels

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_gamepad.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef enum SDL_GamepadButtonLabel
{
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_UNKNOWN,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_A,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_B,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_X,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_Y,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_CROSS,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_CIRCLE,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_SQUARE,
    SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_LABEL_TRIANGLE
} SDL_GamepadButtonLabel;
```

## Remarks

This isn't a complete set, just the face buttons to make it easy to show
button prompts.

For a complete set, you should look at the button and gamepad type and have
a set of symbols that work well with your art style.

## Version

This enum is available since SDL 3.0.0.
