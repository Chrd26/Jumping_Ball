# SDL_AUDIO_FRAMESIZE

Calculate the size of each audio frame (in bytes) from an [SDL_AudioSpec](SDL_AudioSpec).

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_audio.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_audio.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_AUDIO_FRAMESIZE(x) (SDL_AUDIO_BYTESIZE((x).format) * (x).channels)
```

## Macro Parameters

|           |                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **x**     | an [SDL_AudioSpec](SDL_AudioSpec) to query. |

## Return Value

Returns the number of bytes used per sample frame.

## Remarks

This reports on the size of an audio sample frame: stereo Sint16 data (2
channels of 2 bytes each) would be 4 bytes per frame, for example.

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this macro from any thread.

## Version

This macro is available since SDL 3.0.0.
