# SDL_StorageReady

Checks if the storage container is ready to use.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_storage.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_storage.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_StorageReady(SDL_Storage *storage);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **storage**     | a storage container to query |

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) if the container is ready,
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE) otherwise

## Remarks

This function should be called in regular intervals until it returns
[SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) - however, it is not recommended to spinwait on this
call, as the backend may depend on a synchronous message loop.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
