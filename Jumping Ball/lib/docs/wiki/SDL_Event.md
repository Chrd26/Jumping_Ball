# SDL_Event

The structure for all events in SDL.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_events.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_events.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef union SDL_Event
{

    SDL_GamepadAxisEvent gaxis;             /**< Gamepad axis event data */
    SDL_GamepadButtonEvent gbutton;         /**< Gamepad button event data */

    SDL_AudioDeviceEvent adevice;           /**< Audio device event data */
    SDL_CameraDeviceEvent cdevice;          /**< Camera device event data */
    SDL_SensorEvent sensor;                 /**< Sensor event data */
    SDL_QuitEvent quit;                     /**< Quit request event data */
    SDL_UserEvent user;                     /**< Custom event data */
    SDL_TouchFingerEvent tfinger;           /**< Touch finger event data */
    SDL_PenTipEvent ptip;                   /**< Pen tip touching or leaving drawing surface */
    SDL_PenMotionEvent pmotion;             /**< Pen change in position, pressure, or angle */
    SDL_PenButtonEvent pbutton;             /**< Pen button press */
    SDL_DropEvent drop;                     /**< Drag and drop event data */
    SDL_ClipboardEvent clipboard;           /**< Clipboard event data */

    /* This is necessary for ABI compatibility between Visual C++ and GCC.
       Visual C++ will respect the push pack pragma and use 52 bytes (size of
       SDL_TextEditingEvent, the largest structure for 32-bit and 64-bit
       architectures) for this union, and GCC will use the alignment of the
       largest datatype within the union, which is 8 bytes on 64-bit
       architectures.

       So... we'll add padding to force the size to be the same for both.

       On architectures where pointers are 16 bytes, this needs rounding up to
       the next multiple of 16, 64, and on architectures where pointers are
       even larger the size of SDL_UserEvent will dominate as being 3 pointers.
    */
    Uint8 padding[128];
} SDL_Event;

## Version

This struct is available since SDL 3.0.0.
