# SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds

Get the usable desktop area represented by a display, in screen coordinates.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_video.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_video.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_GetDisplayUsableBounds(SDL_DisplayID displayID, SDL_Rect *rect);

```

## Function Parameters

|                   |                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **displayID**     | the instance ID of the display to query                              |
| **rect**          | the [SDL_Rect](SDL_Rect) structure filled in with the display bounds |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

This is the same area as [SDL_GetDisplayBounds](SDL_GetDisplayBounds)()
reports, but with portions reserved by the system removed. For example, on
Apple's macOS, this subtracts the area occupied by the menu bar and dock.

Setting a window to be fullscreen generally bypasses these unusable areas,
so these are good guidelines for the maximum space available to a
non-fullscreen window.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
