# SDL_DialogFileFilter

An entry for filters for file dialogs.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_dialog.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_dialog.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef struct SDL_DialogFileFilter
{
    const char *name;
    const char *pattern;
} SDL_DialogFileFilter;
```

## Remarks

`name` is a user-readable label for the filter (for example, "Office
document").

`pattern` is a semicolon-separated list of file extensions (for example,
"doc;docx"). File extensions may only contain alphanumeric characters,
hyphens, underscores and periods. Alternatively, the whole string can be a
single asterisk ("*"), which serves as an "All files" filter.

## Version

This struct is available since SDL 3.0.0.
