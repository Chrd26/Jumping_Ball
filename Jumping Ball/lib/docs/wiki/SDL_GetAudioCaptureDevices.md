# SDL_GetAudioCaptureDevices

Get a list of currently-connected audio capture devices.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_audio.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_audio.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_AudioDeviceID* SDL_GetAudioCaptureDevices(int *count);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **count**     | a pointer filled in with the number of devices returned |

## Return Value

Returns a 0 terminated array of device instance IDs which should be freed
with [SDL_free](SDL_free)(), or NULL on error; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more details.

## Remarks

This returns of list of available devices that record audio, like a
microphone ("capture" devices). If you want devices that play sound,
perhaps to speakers or headphones ("output" devices), use
[SDL_GetAudioOutputDevices](SDL_GetAudioOutputDevices)() instead.

This only returns a list of physical devices; it will not have any device
IDs returned by [SDL_OpenAudioDevice](SDL_OpenAudioDevice)().

## Thread Safety

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
