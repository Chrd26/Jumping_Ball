# SDL_HINT_PEN_DELAY_MOUSE_BUTTON

A variable controlling whether pen mouse button emulation triggers only when the pen touches the tablet surface.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_PEN_DELAY_MOUSE_BUTTON    "SDL_PEN_DELAY_MOUSE_BUTTON"
```

## Remarks

The variable can be set to the following values:

- "0": The pen reports mouse button press/release immediately when the pen
  button is pressed/released, and the pen tip touching the surface counts
  as left mouse button press.
- "1": Mouse button presses are sent when the pen first touches the tablet
  (analogously for releases). Not pressing a pen button simulates mouse
  button 1, pressing the first pen button simulates mouse button 2 etc.; it
  is not possible to report multiple buttons as pressed at the same time.
  (default)

This hint can be set anytime.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
