###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_DestroyMutex

Destroy a mutex created with [SDL_CreateMutex](SDL_CreateMutex)().

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_mutex.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_mutex.h)

## Syntax

```c
void SDL_DestroyMutex(SDL_Mutex *mutex);

```

## Function Parameters

|               |                      |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| **mutex**     | the mutex to destroy |

## Remarks

This function must be called on any mutex that is no longer needed. Failure
to destroy a mutex will result in a system memory or resource leak. While
it is safe to destroy a mutex that is _unlocked_, it is not safe to attempt
to destroy a locked mutex, and may result in undefined behavior depending
on the platform.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
