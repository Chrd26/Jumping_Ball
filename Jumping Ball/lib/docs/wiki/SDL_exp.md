###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_exp

Compute the exponential of `x`.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h)

## Syntax

```c
double SDL_exp(double x);

```

## Function Parameters

|           |                      |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| **x**     | floating point value |

## Return Value

Returns value of `e^x`

## Remarks

The definition of `y = exp(x)` is `y = e^x`, where `e` is the base of the
natural logarithm. The inverse is the natural logarithm,
[SDL_log](SDL_log).

Domain: `-INF <= x <= INF`

Range: `0 <= y <= INF`

The output will overflow if `exp(x)` is too large to be represented.

This function operates on double-precision floating point values, use
[SDL_expf](SDL_expf) for single-precision floats.

This function may use a different approximation across different versions,
platforms and configurations. i.e, it can return a different value given
the same input on different machines or operating systems, or if SDL is
updated.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
