###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_HINT_AUDIO_DEVICE_APP_NAME

Specify an application name for an audio device.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_AUDIO_DEVICE_APP_NAME "SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_APP_NAME"
```

## Remarks

Some audio backends (such as PulseAudio) allow you to describe your audio
stream. Among other things, this description might show up in a system
control panel that lets the user adjust the volume on specific audio
streams instead of using one giant master volume slider.

This hints lets you transmit that information to the OS. The contents of
this hint are used while opening an audio device. You should use a string
that describes your program ("My Game 2: The Revenge")

Setting this to "" or leaving it unset will have SDL use a reasonable
default: this will be the name set with
[SDL_HINT_APP_NAME](SDL_HINT_APP_NAME), if that hint is set. Otherwise,
it'll probably the application's name or "SDL Application" if SDL doesn't
have any better information.

This hint should be set before an audio device is opened.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
