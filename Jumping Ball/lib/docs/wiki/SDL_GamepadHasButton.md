# SDL_GamepadHasButton

## Header File

## Syntax

```c
SDL_bool SDL_GamepadHasButton(SDL_Gamepad *gamepad, SDL_GamepadButton button);

```

## Function Parameters

|                 |                                                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **gamepad**     | a gamepad                                                             |
| **button**      | a button enum value (an [SDL_GamepadButton](SDL_GamepadButton) value) |

## Return Value

Returns [SDL_TRUE](SDL_TRUE) if the gamepad has this button,
[SDL_FALSE](SDL_FALSE) otherwise.

This merely reports whether the gamepad's mapping defined this button, as
that is all the information SDL has about the physical device.
