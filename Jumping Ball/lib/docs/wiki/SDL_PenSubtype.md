## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_pen.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_pen.h)

## Syntax

```c
typedef enum SDL_PenSubtype
{
    SDL_PEN_TYPE_UNKNOWN = 0,
    SDL_PEN_TYPE_ERASER = 1,                  /**< Eraser */
    SDL_PEN_TYPE_PEN,                         /**< Generic pen; this is the default. */
    SDL_PEN_TYPE_PENCIL,                      /**< Pencil */
    SDL_PEN_TYPE_BRUSH,                       /**< Brush-like device */
    SDL_PEN_TYPE_AIRBRUSH,                    /**< Airbrush device that "sprays" ink */
    SDL_PEN_TYPE_LAST = SDL_PEN_TYPE_AIRBRUSH /**< Last valid pen type */
} SDL_PenSubtype;

airbrush or a pencil).
