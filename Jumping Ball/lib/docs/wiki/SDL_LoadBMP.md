# SDL_LoadBMP

Load a BMP image from a file.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_surface.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_surface.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_Surface* SDL_LoadBMP(const char *file);

```

## Function Parameters

|              |                      |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| **file**     | the BMP file to load |

## Return Value

Returns a pointer to a new [SDL_Surface](SDL_Surface) structure or NULL if
there was an error; call [SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more
information.

## Remarks

The new surface should be freed with
[SDL_DestroySurface](SDL_DestroySurface)(). Not doing so will result in a
memory leak.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
