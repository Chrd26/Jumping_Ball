# SDL_iOSSetAnimationCallback

Use this function to set the animation callback on Apple iOS.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_system.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_system.h)

## Syntax

```c
int SDL_iOSSetAnimationCallback(SDL_Window * window, int interval, void (SDLCALL *callback)(void*), void *callbackParam);

```

## Function Parameters

|                       |                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **window**            | the window for which the animation callback should be set    |
| **interval**          | the number of frames after which **callback** will be called |
| **callback**          | the function to call for every frame.                        |
| **callbackParam**     | a pointer that is passed to `callback`.                      |

## Return Value

Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

The function prototype for `callback` is:

```c
void callback(void* callbackParam);
```

Where its parameter, `callbackParam`, is what was passed as `callbackParam`
to [SDL_iOSSetAnimationCallback](SDL_iOSSetAnimationCallback)().

This function is only available on Apple iOS.

https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/ios

Note that if you use the "main callbacks" instead of a standard C `main`
function, you don't have to use this API, as SDL will manage this for you.

Details on main callbacks are here:

https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
