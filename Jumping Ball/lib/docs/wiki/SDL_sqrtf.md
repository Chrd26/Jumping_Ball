# SDL_sqrtf

Compute the square root of `x`.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h)

## Syntax

```c
float SDL_sqrtf(float x);

```

## Function Parameters

|           |                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **x**     | floating point value. Must be greater than or equal to 0. |

## Return Value

Returns square root of `x`

## Remarks

Domain: `0 <= x <= INF`

Range: `0 <= y <= INF`

This function operates on single-precision floating point values, use
[SDL_sqrt](SDL_sqrt) for double-precision floats.

This function may use a different approximation across different versions,
platforms and configurations. i.e, it can return a different value given
the same input on different machines or operating systems, or if SDL is
updated.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
