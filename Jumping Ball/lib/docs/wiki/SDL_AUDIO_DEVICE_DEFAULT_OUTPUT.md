###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_OUTPUT

A value used to request a default output audio device.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_audio.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_audio.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_OUTPUT ((SDL_AudioDeviceID) 0xFFFFFFFF)
```

## Remarks

Several functions that require an [SDL_AudioDeviceID](SDL_AudioDeviceID)
will accept this value to signify the app just wants the system to choose a
default device instead of the app providing a specific one.

## Version

This macro is available since SDL 3.0.0.
