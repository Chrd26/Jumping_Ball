###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_HINT_HIDAPI_IGNORE_DEVICES

A variable containing a list of devices to ignore in [SDL_hid_enumerate](SDL_hid_enumerate)().

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_HIDAPI_IGNORE_DEVICES "SDL_HIDAPI_IGNORE_DEVICES"
```

## Remarks

The format of the string is a comma separated list of USB VID/PID pairs in
hexadecimal form, e.g.

`0xAAAA/0xBBBB,0xCCCC/0xDDDD`

For example, to ignore the Shanwan DS3 controller and any Valve controller,
you might use the string "0x2563/0x0523,0x28de/0x0000"

This hint can be set anytime.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
