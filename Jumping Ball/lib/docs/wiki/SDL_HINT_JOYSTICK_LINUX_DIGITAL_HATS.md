# SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_LINUX_DIGITAL_HATS

A variable controlling whether joysticks on Linux will always treat 'hat' axis inputs (ABS_HAT0X - ABS_HAT3Y) as 8-way digital hats without checking whether they may be analog.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_LINUX_DIGITAL_HATS "SDL_JOYSTICK_LINUX_DIGITAL_HATS"
```

## Remarks

The variable can be set to the following values:

- "0": Only map hat axis inputs to digital hat outputs if the input axes
  appear to actually be digital. (default)
- "1": Always handle the input axes numbered ABS_HAT0X to ABS_HAT3Y as
  digital hats.

This hint should be set before a controller is opened.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
