# SDL_LoadFile

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_iostream.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_iostream.h)

## Syntax

```c
void* SDL_LoadFile(const char *file, size_t *datasize);

```

## Function Parameters

|                  |                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **file**         | the path to read all available data from         |
| **datasize**     | if not NULL, will store the number of bytes read |

## Return Value

The data is allocated with a zero byte at the end (null terminated) for

`datasize`.

The data should be freed with [SDL_free](SDL_free)().
