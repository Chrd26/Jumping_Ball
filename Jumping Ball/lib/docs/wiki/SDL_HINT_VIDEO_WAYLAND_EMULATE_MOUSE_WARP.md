###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_EMULATE_MOUSE_WARP

Enable or disable mouse pointer warp emulation, needed by some older games.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_hints.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_hints.h)

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_EMULATE_MOUSE_WARP "SDL_VIDEO_WAYLAND_EMULATE_MOUSE_WARP"
```

## Remarks

Wayland does not directly support warping the mouse. When this hint is set,
any SDL will emulate mouse warps using relative mouse mode. This is
required for some older games (such as Source engine games), which warp the
mouse to the centre of the screen rather than using relative mouse motion.
Note that relative mouse mode may have different mouse acceleration
behaviour than pointer warps.

The variable can be set to the following values:

- "0": All mouse warps fail, as mouse warping is not available under
  wayland.
- "1": Some mouse warps will be emulated by forcing relative mouse mode.

If not set, this is automatically enabled unless an application uses
relative mouse mode directly.

This hint can be set anytime.

## Version

This hint is available since SDL 3.0.0.
