###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_acosf

Compute the arc cosine of `x`.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_stdinc.h)

## Syntax

```c
float SDL_acosf(float x);

```

## Function Parameters

|           |                       |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| **x**     | floating point value. |

## Return Value

Returns arc cosine of `x`, in radians

## Remarks

The definition of `y = acos(x)` is `x = cos(y)`.

Domain: `-1 <= x <= 1`

Range: `0 <= y <= Pi`

This function operates on single-precision floating point values, use
[SDL_acos](SDL_acos) for double-precision floats.

This function may use a different approximation across different versions,
platforms and configurations. i.e, it can return a different value given
the same input on different machines or operating systems, or if SDL is
updated.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
