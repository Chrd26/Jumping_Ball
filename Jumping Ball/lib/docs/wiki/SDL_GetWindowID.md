# SDL_GetWindowID

Get the numeric ID of a window.

## Header File

Defined in [<SDL3/SDL_video.h>](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/include/SDL3/SDL_video.h)

## Syntax

```c
SDL_WindowID SDL_GetWindowID(SDL_Window *window);

```

## Function Parameters

|                |                     |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| **window**     | the window to query |

## Return Value

Returns the ID of the window on success or 0 on failure; call
[SDL_GetError](SDL_GetError)() for more information.

## Remarks

The numeric ID is what [SDL_WindowEvent](SDL_WindowEvent) references, and
is necessary to map these events to specific [SDL_Window](SDL_Window)
objects.

## Version

This function is available since SDL 3.0.0.
