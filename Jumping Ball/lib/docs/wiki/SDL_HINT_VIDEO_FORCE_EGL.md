###### (This is the documentation for SDL3, which is under heavy development and the API is changing! [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/) is the current stable version!)
# SDL_HINT_VIDEO_FORCE_EGL

A variable controlling whether the OpenGL context should be created with EGL.

## Header File

## Syntax

```c
#define SDL_HINT_VIDEO_FORCE_EGL "SDL_VIDEO_FORCE_EGL"
```

The variable can be set to the following values:

- "0": Use platform-specific GL context creation API (GLX, WGL, CGL, etc).
  (default)
