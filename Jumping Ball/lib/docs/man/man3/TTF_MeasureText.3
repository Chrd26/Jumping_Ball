.TH TTF_MeasureText 3 "SDL_ttf 3.0.0" "SDL_ttf" "SDL_ttf3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
TTF_MeasureText \- Calculate how much of a Latin1 string will fit in a given width\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_ttf/SDL_ttf.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int TTF_MeasureText(TTF_Font *font, const char *text, int measure_width, int *extent, int *count);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This reports the number of characters that can be rendered before reaching
.BR measure_width
\[char46]

This does not need to render the string to do this calculation\[char46]

You almost certainly want 
.BR TTF_MeasureUTF8
() unless
you're sure you have a 1-byte Latin1 encoding\[char46] US ASCII characters will
work with either function, but most other Unicode characters packed into a
.BR const char *
will need UTF-8\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I font
the font to query\[char46]
.TP
.I text
text to calculate, in Latin1 encoding\[char46]
.TP
.I measure_width
maximum width, in pixels, available for the string\[char46]
.TP
.I count
on return, filled with number of characters that can be rendered\[char46]
.TP
.I extent
on return, filled with latest calculated width\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 if successful, -1 on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_ttf 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
