.SH NAME
TTF_RenderGlyph_Shaded \- Render a single 16-bit glyph at high quality to a new 8-bit surface\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_ttf/SDL_ttf.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "SDL_Surface * TTF_RenderGlyph_Shaded(TTF_Font *font,
.BI "                Uint16 ch, SDL_Color fg, SDL_Color bg);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function will allocate a new 8-bit, palettized surface\[char46] The surface's
0 pixel will be the specified background color, while other pixels have
varying degrees of the foreground color\[char46] This function returns the new
surface, or NULL if there was an error\[char46]

The glyph is rendered without any padding or centering in the X direction,
and aligned normally in the Y direction\[char46]

Note that this version of the function takes a 16-bit character code, which
covers the Basic Multilingual Plane, but is insufficient to cover the
entire set of possible Unicode values, including emoji glyphs\[char46] You should
use 
.BR TTF_RenderGlyph32_Shaded
() instead, which
offers the same functionality but takes a 32-bit codepoint instead\[char46]

The only reason to use this function is that it was available since the
beginning of time, more or less\[char46]

You can render at other quality levels with

.BR TTF_RenderGlyph_Solid
,

.BR TTF_RenderGlyph_Blended
, and

.BR TTF_RenderGlyph_LCD
\[char46]
