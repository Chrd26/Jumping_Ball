.TH TTF_GlyphMetrics 3 "SDL_ttf 3.0.0" "SDL_ttf" "SDL_ttf3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
TTF_GlyphMetrics \- Query the metrics (dimensions) of a font's 16-bit glyph\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_ttf/SDL_ttf.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int TTF_GlyphMetrics(TTF_Font *font, Uint16 ch,
.BI "int *minx, int *maxx,
.BI "int *miny, int *maxy, int *advance);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
To understand what these metrics mean, here is a useful link:

https://freetype\[char46]sourceforge\[char46]net/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2\[char46]html

Note that this version of the function takes a 16-bit character code, which
covers the Basic Multilingual Plane, but is insufficient to cover the
entire set of possible Unicode values, including emoji glyphs\[char46] You should
use 
.BR TTF_GlyphMetrics32
() instead, which offers the
same functionality but takes a 32-bit codepoint instead\[char46]

The only reason to use this function is that it was available since the
beginning of time, more or less\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I font
the font to query\[char46]
.TP
.I ch
the character code to check\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_ttf 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]
