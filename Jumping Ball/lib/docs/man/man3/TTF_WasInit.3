.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_ttf/SDL_ttf.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int TTF_WasInit(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This reports the number of times the library has been initialized by a call
to 
.BR TTF_Init
(), without a paired deinitialization request from

.BR TTF_Quit
()\[char46]

In short: if it's greater than zero, the library is currently initialized
and ready to work\[char46] If zero, it is not initialized\[char46]

Despite the return value being a signed integer, this function should not
return a negative number\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the current number of initialization calls, that need to eventually
be paired with this many calls to 
.BR TTF_Quit
()\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_ttf 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO

.BR TTF_Quit (3)
